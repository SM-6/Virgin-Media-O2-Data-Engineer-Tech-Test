# Virgin-Media-O2-Data-Engineer-Tech-Test

**Project Overview**

This project is for the Virgin Media O2 Data Engineering tech test.

**Description**

In accordance with the provided instructions, I've developed a batch pipeline capable of reading a CSV file, executing various data transformation processes, and generating a new CSV file in the designated output location. The complete end-to-end solution is encapsulated in the file named `composite_transform_file.py`,  available in this repository.

**Instructions**

To execute the pipeline:

1. Set up a virtual environment.
2. Activate the virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.
4. Run `composite_transform_file.py`, which will generate the desired CSV file.
